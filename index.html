        <p> <i>Karnataka is a state in the Republic of India. It has an area of 74,122 square miles (191,980 km2). It is bigger than Syria but smaller than Senegal. In traditional Indian geography, it is part of the Southern zone. It has 31 districts. As of the 2011 census, it has a population of approximately 61.1 million.[1] The present Chief Minister of the state is Basavaraj Bommai from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</i><br><i>Provisions for the formation of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir were contained within the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which was passed by both houses of the Parliament of India in August 2019. The act re-constituted the former state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, one being Jammu and Kashmir and the other being Ladakh, with effect from 31 October 2019.</i> <br><br><br> <b>Its major features include the ruins of the Indus Valley civilisation at Kalibangan and Balathal, the Dilwara Temples, a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the ancient Aravalli mountain range and eastern Rajasthan, the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site[12] known for its bird life.<b> <br><br><br><br> <u>The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India.</u></p>
